This article presents an innovative approach for detecting lead and copper in buried pipes by integrating COMSOL Multiphysics simulations with machine learning techniques. The enhanced model includes a soil block to replicate real-world conditions and utilizes accelerometers for data acquisition. The collected data is processed and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately identify the presence of these metals. This method aims to offer a more efficient and non-invasive solution to metal detection in water systems.
