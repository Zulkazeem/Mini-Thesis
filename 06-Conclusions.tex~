\chapter{Conclusions}

This study presents a novel method for detecting lead and copper in buried pipes by integrating COMSOL simulations with machine learning techniques. The enhanced model and extensive dataset generation contribute to a more accurate and efficient detection system. Future work will focus on optimizing the computational aspects and further validating the model with real-world data.
