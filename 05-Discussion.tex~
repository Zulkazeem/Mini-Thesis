\chapter{Discussion}


The combined use of COMSOL and machine learning demonstrated significant potential in improving the efficiency and accuracy of metal detection in water systems. The enhanced model, which includes a soil block and steel rod, effectively simulates real-world conditions. The generated dataset and subsequent training of the CNN highlight the feasibility of this approach. However, the process was slowed by the computational resources required, indicating a need for optimization in future work.
