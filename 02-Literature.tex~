\chapter{Literature Review} 
\label{ch:lit}

Numerous studies have explored various methods for detecting lead and copper in water systems. Traditional methods include physical inspections and chemical testing, which have limitations in terms of cost and efficiency. Recent research has not focused on the use of simulation software, such as COMSOL Multiphysics, and machine learning algorithms to enhance detection capabilities. This is thus an integrating these technologies for practical applications remains an area of active research. The following article is structured as thus: the methodology that describes the process that was used for the experiment, the result that shows the output from the model, the discussion, and finally the conclusion.
