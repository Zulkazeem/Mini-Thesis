\chapter{Conclusions}
\noindent
This study presents a novel method for detecting lead and copper in buried pipes by integrating COMSOL simulations with machine learning techniques. The enhanced model and extensive dataset generation contribute to a more accurate and efficient detection system. This is not only limited to lead and copper detecion but can be expanded for uses in other areas that involve detection of metal underground without digging into it.
